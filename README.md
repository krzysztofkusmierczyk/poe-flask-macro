# Path of Exile Flask Macro

A simple flask macro for Path of Exile.

## What it does?

It automatically uses you flasks (presses buttons 2345) after pressing <kbd>`</kbd> (tilde) key. It takes into account the duration of your flasks, so it will use a flask only after it expired.

## How to use?

You will need python and `pynput` installed to run this script.

Download `main.py` and edit `FLASK_DURATIONS` with your flask durations in milliseconds.

Run the script and press the <kbd>`</kbd> (tilde) key

## Why another flask macro?

I don't like AHK and I don't trust macros made by others. Mine macro is small, without convoluted logic and exactly fits my needs.

## Can I get banned?

Yes, highly unlikely but still possible. Use at own risk.
